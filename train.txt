icollection adds counting and ilist then gives richer functionality including find add and remove elements by index or via lambda expressions  __label__capabilities
one could argue that a lighter framework such as sinatra if you re going to use ruby or something like bottle python or the javascript stack of node.js + express would be a better fit if you truly are just going to create a restful api + some landing pages but rails does this perfectly fine as well and has a lot of other functionality that will be available for you to grow into if the time ever comes  __label__capabilities

jpgraph has far more capabilities than phpgraphlib  __label__capabilities
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs  __label__capabilities
i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing  __label__capabilities
swing is relatively similar to awt apart from the fact that swing has more capabilities awt is probably the simplest form to start out with and has most if not all of the tools to complete your project hope this helps  __label__capabilities

i am pretty sure mysql have similar capabilities of importing csv i just generally prefer postgresql  __label__capabilities
however i find postgresql to support more sql features than mysql and be more efficient when handling more data  __label__capabilities
this paper goes into this in depth but if you use a standard lda package i d recommend mallet they should have this functionality already  __label__capabilities
further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me  __label__capabilities
even though aurora has better capabilities i prefer marathon due to auroras complexity overhead and lack of ui for control api  __label__capabilities
the reason that you would choose adfs over iwa is that both authenticate against ad but only adfs adds sso and federation functionality  __label__capabilities
please keep in mind that qmake and qbs are two very different build systems with fundamentally different designs and capabilities and qbs verbosity is in part due to its fundamental architectural differences which make it far more powerful than qmake will ever be capable of  __label__capabilities

i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult  __label__documented
finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy  __label__documented
either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really  __label__documented
i would recommend using theano binary lstm link or keras tutorial for this because they are fairly simple to understand and are well documented  __label__documented
it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented  __label__documented

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory  __label__memory
according to these benchmarks it also uses less memory and cpu resources than nginx or lighttpd while running faster  __label__memory
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components  __label__memory
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t  __label__memory
suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p  __label__memory
one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer  __label__memory
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash  __label__memory
firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie  __label__memory
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled  __label__memory

if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors  __label__memory
int occupy more memory than boolean so the heap got corrupted  __label__memory
everyone know int needs aroud 4 times more memory than chars  __label__memory
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort  __label__memory
you made the right choice using setinterval instead of settimeout here as in this case settimeout would have been less efficient with memory resources  __label__memory
first don t use wav as it takes up too much memory mp3 is better  __label__memory
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort  __label__memory
my experience is that you should prefer vmware but that s only because i had some crashes and memory loss with virtualbox  __label__memory
if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory  __label__memory
xrange will give you an iterable object that won t use memory as you iterate a for-loop is cleaner than a while loops + counter if you ask me  __label__memory

if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory  __label__memory
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie  __label__memory
memory allocation in java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc calloc etc  __label__memory
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression  __label__memory

cmd processors consumes more than 60 of cpu and memory and runs for a while  __label__memory
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie  __label__memory
on top of that the memory allocated with malloc will take up more space than the actual string both because the malloc and free functions need a bit of information next to the memory block to be able to do their job and because typically the size is rounded up to some good size 8 16 or 32 bytes  __label__memory
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression  __label__memory
the amount of memory reserved depends on the data type a chars will take up more memory than an int  __label__memory
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort  __label__memory
if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables  __label__memory
in case of primitives memory comes into play.if you are going to store double into int as in your example double takes more memory as compare to integer.so there is chance of data lose.so compiler throw error.if you cast yourself then you know what you are doing so compiler let that do  __label__memory
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory  __label__memory
when you want to allocate memory via functions as malloc and calloc it is better that you use a variable for the size of memory to be allocated  __label__memory
try vtd-xml it is much faster than jdom upto 10x and dom4j or dom and also memory efficient  __label__memory
but after one hour i see that firefox and google-chrome got more that 1 gb of memory and sometimes even firefox crashes  __label__memory

i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval  __label__memory
sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data  __label__memory

udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability  __label__secure
we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson  __label__secure
one thing to note is that std istream getline is more secure than std getline so should be preferred in some situations  __label__secure
actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure  __label__secure
it was therefore deemed safer for the beginners to default to myisam and expect those that now what they are doing to amend the config or specifically select innodb in phpmyadmin when they know that is the table type they want to use  __label__secure
typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri  __label__secure
i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer  __label__secure
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url  __label__secure
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example  __label__secure
edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module  __label__secure
you may also try to signal the same page about a valid log-in by sending some information to the same page using the post or get methods post is more secure but i don t recommend it for this purpose at all  __label__secure
note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer  __label__secure
you should use a strong cryptographic hash function and a salt to make it more secure  __label__secure
also instead of using atoi use the safer counterpart strtol  __label__secure
myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data  __label__secure
it seems to me that using an unsigned integer type is safer as the constructor can then never be called with an invalid parameter value  __label__secure
using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash  __label__secure
if you want to be more secure you can send the sms s more often however there is a way to understand sim-card change this is for t-mobile and europe use i guess from within the app so that the user cant fool you by enetering sms for a different msisdn and then change to his her real msisdn sim card  __label__secure
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency  __label__secure
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data  __label__secure
sodium_crypto_generichash which is blake2b a hash function more secure than md5 but faster than sha256  __label__secure
if you want the entire communication to be secure not only sending username password you can use a symmetric cipher algorithm aes because asymmetric cipher algorithms rsa are much slower and consume more resources  __label__secure

get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side  __label__secure
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default  __label__secure
ps again i am aware that relying on client-side script is way less secure compared with handling all execution from within the server-side  __label__secure
using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative  __label__secure
it is also non-standard unsafe and non-portable basically worse than using malloc and free in c++  __label__secure
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable  __label__secure
i find the best way is to create a cache session folder in your systems directory is more safer i put important things like logs and cache in system rather than application folder  __label__secure
double md5 hashing is actually less secure than a single hash with some attack vectors  __label__secure
but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp  __label__secure
udp might be faster than tcp but it doesn t have the error detection and correction you are going to need in order to have a safe transfer of data  __label__secure
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa  __label__secure
locking unlocking in the getter setter is much safer you cannot forget to do it and more convenient the lock does not have to be directly accessable everywhere you use the property than an external lock on every property access  __label__secure
in effect post is no more secure than get  __label__secure
the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but it depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed  __label__secure
on the other hand the secure tunnel created in a vpn is far more secure than remote desktop  __label__secure
if your shell is bash or ksh or zsh it s much safer and easier to build up a command with an array rather than a string  __label__secure
if you want to do this - and are in-fact okay with having more larger hash data to store compare - you would be much better advise to simply run a different hash function other than md5 that is either more secure and or uses a larger number of bits  __label__secure
use a secure hashing algorithm like pbkdf2 a good one out of others and compare hash later on  __label__secure
tortoise now has an option push new branch that may be safer than force pull or push  __label__secure
asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes  __label__secure
i need a sip server hopefully simpler more efficient and more secure than asterisk or other full-featured pbx to just terminate sip calls and play audio based on the incoming number  __label__secure
using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash  __label__secure
it worth mentioning that post is more secure and can carry more data since it uses the actual request body unlike get that appends the parameters to the url  __label__secure
words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice  __label__secure
while 256-bit aes might sound less secure than 4096-bit rsa they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection  __label__secure
client-side validations can be overriden hacked thus server-side are more secure  __label__secure
for instance if the high word is less than the modulo then it is safe to perform the division like this  __label__secure
firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down  __label__secure
in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt  __label__secure
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server  __label__secure
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors  __label__secure
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe  __label__secure
i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment  __label__secure
the framework has also improved majorly not to mention it supports pdo mysqli more secure than mysql and postgresql  __label__secure
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post  __label__secure
characters post is more robust and secure than get  __label__secure
while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c  __label__secure
for example if the data needs reliability it will create a socket with sock_stream so it will select tcp otherwise if it doesn t need any reliability i will use sock_dgram for udp  __label__secure
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed  __label__secure
using sha256 with a salt will be much more secure than md5  __label__secure
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries  __label__secure
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed  __label__secure
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability  __label__secure
as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people  __label__secure
it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower  __label__secure
server-side validation is more secure than the client-side as the user cannot see the code even he does a view-source  __label__secure
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available  __label__secure
using prepare and execute should be faster safer easier and it won t make you feel like you re writing php in 1999  __label__secure
hash password by using security salt is more secure than plain text password  __label__secure
this method also allows you to put the url within the action parameter of the form and uses post which is more secured for transferring password information  __label__secure
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml  __label__secure
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions  __label__secure
as you suspect a normal free and malloc would be faster but that s because they do less  __label__speed
i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux  __label__speed

so gethashcode should be much faster than actually running equals  __label__speed
it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx  __label__speed
if everything works use apc or memcached instead of files files usually work great but apc memc are faster  __label__speed
the problem is that memcpy is only slighly slower than memset when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory  __label__speed

while ruby and rails don t change as often as they did a few years ago the dev ecosystem still evolves faster than linux distributions like ubuntu can keep up with  __label__speed
i would choose option 1 for better performances apc or memcached are faster storage than filesystem and for having more control on what s happening in your project  __label__speed
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right  __label__speed
python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications  __label__speed
reading and writing raw arrays of int and double will be faster than converting to and from text but then you need to worry about byte ordering differences in sizes for different platforms compilers structure padding etc  __label__speed
incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox  __label__speed
it s 4 times faster than using malloc free and copying your data when scaling up  __label__speed
it can be quite much faster than md5 sha functions and it produces good hash considering it output but it produces a smaller range of hash 64-bit output and as such is more likely to cause more conflicts  __label__speed
as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well  __label__speed
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection  __label__speed
as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram  __label__speed
non-crypto hash are often faster than crc-32 and produce more random output similar to slow cryptographic hash md5 sha  __label__speed
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads  __label__speed
but sometimes postgresql is faster than mysql or mariadb  __label__speed
when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower  __label__speed
on modern hardware floating point multiplications may run way faster than int ones so you might want to change the entire algorithm and start using double instead of int  __label__speed
in my opinion calling getter and setter is slower than direct access to a field  __label__speed
i have written a memory allocator that is supposedly faster than using malloc free  __label__speed
typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast  __label__speed
as you see md2 is also much much shower than the other hash the same outcome as with the php code but md5 is much faster than sha-1 and overall it took less time in delphi to do the same on the same machine as php  __label__speed
i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp  __label__speed
however some of them like md5 have less possible hash and execute faster  __label__speed

my guess is that iphone tutorials use properties to make it easier for new developers to jump through memory management even though it s handy to generate appropriate accessor with properties rather than implement them by hand every time  __label__useeasier
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell  __label__useeasier
also the show and hide functions are easier than animating the opacity  __label__useeasier
i agree with previous answers but i would also recommend to use proper java build tool - like ant perceived easier to use but not necessary or maven perceived more difficult to use but really worth learning  __label__useeasier
of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me  __label__useeasier

the only problem is that we don t know what to use our very own engine with awt or if we could use swing to make it easier  __label__useeasier
on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c  __label__useeasier
but its a good practice to always put the brackets to help making your code easier to read so you wouldn t get confused in more complex algorithms  __label__useeasier
download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c  __label__useeasier
